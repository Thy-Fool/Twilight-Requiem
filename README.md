# Twilight-Requiem
A 2-d top down adventure game made in python using the pygame module. 
Many of the assets are self made, but many are either taken from the internet, or just extracted from the Legend of Zelda: Minish Cap(Trying to focus on the coding first.)
The required modules to run the game are pygame and OpenCV-python(For the video playback in the menu.)
